You would never guess what can happen when you jump into a seemingly shallow puddle at night time!
It turns out that it is not a puddle rather than a giant hole which brings you to a new world on the other side of the light water.
Now you are left stunning and don't know what to do.
So you decide to call Whoolio who lives in Never Never land.
You can't believe your eyes. There are magical creatures of all shapes and sizes in all directions!
You tried to walk, but your body was not listening to you and it was very difficult to make a step
So you reached out your arm as far as it would go to see if you coud touch a creature.
Just as you are about to touch one of the creatures the world around you suddenly shatters like a glass pane.

You think to yourself "What a strange effect." And proceed to drink a glass of milk.
Thankfully, the milk has been spiked with disinfectant which allows sunlight to penetrate into your body. 
The strange brew then causes your body to clone itself into two yous!  Bit-by-bit and byte-by-byte your entire is duplicated beside you.
Except, it seems to be a younger, better looking version of yourself.
Just one thought arrowed my head in that moment - "My clone... is it friend or enemy?"
If it is my enemy, I must keep them close! The next morning you awake with the clone standing above you with a malevolent look in his eye and he plunges toward you,a woman kicks in the door and trips your clone and tosses you into the back of a speeding van, she says she was sent back in time by the Nomad A.I resistance to protect you from …
